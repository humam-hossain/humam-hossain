To create a portfolio website using Next.js, you will need to:

Set up a Next.js project:
First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (the Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
Then, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.

Run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npm init next-app
```

This will prompt you to choose a project name and a template. Choose a name for your portfolio website and select the default template (which is a basic starter template with a single page and a few example components).

Design your portfolio website:
Next, you'll need to design your portfolio website. You can use a tool like Adobe XD, Figma, or Sketch to design the layout and user interface for your website.

Think about what information you want to include on your portfolio website. Some common things to include are:

Your name and a short bio
Your work experience
Your education
Your skills and technical expertise
Links to your social media profiles or other online profiles
Examples of your work (e.g., projects, writing samples, etc.)
Implement your design:
Once you have a design for your portfolio website, it's time to start building it. Next.js uses React components to build the user interface, so you'll need to have a basic understanding of React to complete this step.

Start by creating a basic layout for your website using the <Layout> component provided by Next.js. This component allows you to define a common layout that will be used throughout your website, such as a header, footer, and navigation menu.

Then, create the individual pages for your website. In Next.js, each page is a separate React component that is rendered when the user navigates to that page.

Use the Next.js Link component to create links between your pages. This will allow users to navigate between the different pages of your website.

Add content to your website:
Finally, you'll need to add content to your website. This will likely involve creating and styling additional React components to display your information and examples of your work.

Make sure to use responsive design techniques to ensure that your website looks good on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
