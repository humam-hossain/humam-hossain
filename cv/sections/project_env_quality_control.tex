\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em, itemsep=0.1em, labelsep=0.5em]
    \item Developed a comprehensive sensor network using \textbf{Arduino Mega 2560} as the MCU, integrating multiple environmental sensors (MQ gas sensors, DHT22 humidity \& temperature sensor, DSM501A particulate matter sensor, flame sensor) for real-time hazard detection with integrated user interface including OLED display, control buttons, LEDs, and buzzer for independent operation.

    \item Developed complete web infrastructure with \textbf{Django} REST API backend using \textbf{SQLite} database for data ingestion and timestamped storage, \textbf{React} frontend featuring real-time monitoring dashboard with interactive charts and hazard analysis capabilities, and end-to-end data pipeline utilizing \textbf{ESP8266 WiFi module} as a communication bridge between the standalone hardware device and web infrastructure, enabling seamless data transmission via AT commands over UART and processing sensor readings from Arduino HTTP POST requests through API validation to live client-side visualization updates.
